# Create virtual environment for our python app
Virtual environment is the tool to keep the dependency required by different projects in a separate place.

*Project A depends on Version 1 but Project B depends on Version 2, so the virtual environment helps us to manage all this easily.*

## Create virtual environment

`virtualenv deploytodoenv/deploytodotasker`

**Output:** New folder named deploytodoenv and inside it deploytodotasker.


## Activate virtual environment

`Go to Scripts and enter activate.`

**Output:** You will see (deploytodotasker) like this in parenthesis.
